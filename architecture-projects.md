## Civic Unity
*Professor: Lopez, Matt*
*Location: Troy, NY*
*Team: Skye Nieves*

*Troy, NY contains a rich history, from its early days as a settlement on the
Hudson River to its emergence as the “Collar City” due to its pivotal role in the
production of detachable shirt collars. Like many industrial cities, Troy faced
decline during the 19th century as the U.S. entered a post-industrial era. To
day, however, the city is experiencing a revival, and the development of a new
city hall would significantly contribute to this revitalization effort.
Drawing inspiration from Troy’s existing context and local architectural features,
the proposed design for the city hall aims to meld together the community.
The building takes the form of a circle, symbolizing unity and wholeness, and
is designed to integrate public and administrative functions. The circular layout
fosters a sense of connection between the city’s government and its residents,
with all programs linked by an inner circulation path.
The use of glass and an open courtyard invites transparency and visibility,
allowing the public to see and engage with the functions of city hall. The
courtyard itself serves as a communal space, becoming the centerpoint of the
design—an area where the people of Troy can gather and connect. Positioned
near the waterfront and the popular farmers market, two essential parts of
Troy’s fabric, the city hall creates pathways that connect to these features. The
grand entrance, facing the Hudson River, offers a welcoming gesture to the
city from the water, reinforcing Troy’s connection to its historic riverfront.*
