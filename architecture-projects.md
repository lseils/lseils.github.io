## Civic Unity
**City Hall**

*Professor: Lopez, Matt*
*Location: Troy, NY*
*Team: Skye Nieves*

*Troy, NY contains a rich history, from its early days as a settlement on the
Hudson River to its emergence as the “Collar City” due to its pivotal role in the
production of detachable shirt collars. Like many industrial cities, Troy faced
decline during the 19th century as the U.S. entered a post-industrial era. To
day, however, the city is experiencing a revival, and the development of a new
city hall would significantly contribute to this revitalization effort.
Drawing inspiration from Troy’s existing context and local architectural features,
the proposed design for the city hall aims to meld together the community.
The building takes the form of a circle, symbolizing unity and wholeness, and
is designed to integrate public and administrative functions. The circular layout
fosters a sense of connection between the city’s government and its residents,
with all programs linked by an inner circulation path.
The use of glass and an open courtyard invites transparency and visibility,
allowing the public to see and engage with the functions of city hall. The
courtyard itself serves as a communal space, becoming the centerpoint of the
design—an area where the people of Troy can gather and connect. Positioned
near the waterfront and the popular farmers market, two essential parts of
Troy’s fabric, the city hall creates pathways that connect to these features. The
grand entrance, facing the Hudson River, offers a welcoming gesture to the
city from the water, reinforcing Troy’s connection to its historic riverfront.*

## Folded Narratives
**Community Center**

*Professor: Fleet, Hower*
*Location: Albany, NY*
*Team: Cooper Meyers, Eileen Dong*

*The adaptive reuse of the Guild House at 62 South Swan St. seeks to
reintroduce the original funtions of this historic site into the modernday
landscape through the concept of folding. There are two dimensions to the
folding. There is a physical folding of the facade and interior partitions, and a
conceptual folding of the past into the present.
The main entrance has been moved from the west face of the building to the
north face to provide an easy and accessible entrance to all. Upon entering the
Guild House, one is greeted with an imagery of a building inside of a building.
The Guild House as it currently sits, is a shell of what it has been. Our proposal
will bring life into this shell by emphasizing the interstitialspaces between the
old and new. This space allows both mental and physical acknowledgment of
the gap that the decline of the Guild House has left in its community.
The large architectural bay window allows one to peer into the new future of
the Guild House, a place to once again server the immigrants and children of
its community. It will provide a variety of classes and services for immigrants
to help them navigate life in the United States, child care for working class
families, and after school programs to help students reach their full potential.*

## Comprehensive Studio 1
**Library**

*Professor: Svedburg, Per. S**
*Location: New York, NY*

*The site is located in the heart of Chelsea. Chelsea has a lot of art gallaries and
is the home for The Highline, an elevated park that spans part of Manhatten.
The library sits on 10th Ave. and 27th St. North. It acts as a connection from
the street to The Highline while being a part of the community. The site spans
over 2 lots of land and part of it slides under The Higline.
There is no doubt that The Highline is one of the most important parts to the
site. The library has direct access to The Highline via the second floor. The
building connects the street to The Highline, internally, with a staircase that
also acts as seating. As you go up in the building, the staircases land you
infront of windows looking down to The Highline.  
In this project, NYC codes and standards were used. There are various zoning
codes that were followed in order to simulate a more real life project. Structure,
program, and occupancy were just a few important details what were thor-
oughly thought out.*

## Comprehensive Studio 2
**Library**

*Professor: Combs, Lonn*
*Location: New York, NY*

*The site is located in the heart of Chelsea. Chelsea has a lot of art gallaries
and is the home for The Highline, an elevated park that spans part of
Manhatten. This library acts as a connection from the street to The Highline
while being a community node.  
The library is made up of two different sections. The lower half acts as a public
area that is shown to be more open via the atrium and facade rythems. This
free flowing space acts as a connection to the com nity where people can
socialize. The upper half of the building is quieter and compact. This allows
library goes to read or study in the library without being as distracted by the
travelers in the lower part of the building. This library gets to serve all kinds of
people and preferences of the community.  
This library is a continuation and re-vamp of the library in Comprehensive
Studio 1. It takes the original library but improves on the original ideas
while going into more depth of the construction, materials, program, and
enviornmental qualities.*

## Benningtion Museum
**Historical Museum**

*Professor: Erel, Yael*
*Location: Bennington, VT*

*The Bennington Museum is located in Vermont and it sits on a 10-acre
site. The Bennington Museum connects the Town of Benningiton and
Old Bennington. The muesum, founded in 1852, is essential to the local
community, holding collections, and providing public spaces. The muesum
holds a wide variety of collections, some being historic relics and interesting
art. The museum has seen addition on top of addition. It is made up of many
different kinds of exhibits that all have their own feel to them. There are a lot of
inconsistencies that came along because of all of the additions.  
This new addition played off of the inconsistencies. The different shaped brick
stones take inspiration from the original museum. The masonry is modernized
but also exhibits the idea of the form inconsistencies of the existing musuem.
There is also a play between view vs. lighting. The small windows in the
eroded part of the addition can only act as lighting. However, the large end
windows act as specific views. There is a cafe that is central to this addition. It
is in a location that is accessible at the beginning or end of your tour.*
