## Civic Unity
**City Hall**

*Professor: Lopez, Matt*
*Location: Troy, NY*
*Team: Skye Nieves*

*Troy, NY contains a rich history, from its early days as a settlement on the
Hudson River to its emergence as the “Collar City” due to its pivotal role in the
production of detachable shirt collars. Like many industrial cities, Troy faced
decline during the 19th century as the U.S. entered a post-industrial era. To
day, however, the city is experiencing a revival, and the development of a new
city hall would significantly contribute to this revitalization effort.
Drawing inspiration from Troy’s existing context and local architectural features,
the proposed design for the city hall aims to meld together the community.
The building takes the form of a circle, symbolizing unity and wholeness, and
is designed to integrate public and administrative functions. The circular layout
fosters a sense of connection between the city’s government and its residents,
with all programs linked by an inner circulation path.
The use of glass and an open courtyard invites transparency and visibility,
allowing the public to see and engage with the functions of city hall. The
courtyard itself serves as a communal space, becoming the centerpoint of the
design—an area where the people of Troy can gather and connect. Positioned
near the waterfront and the popular farmers market, two essential parts of
Troy’s fabric, the city hall creates pathways that connect to these features. The
grand entrance, facing the Hudson River, offers a welcoming gesture to the
city from the water, reinforcing Troy’s connection to its historic riverfront.*

## Folded Narratives
**Community Center**

*Professor: Fleet, Hower*
*Location: Albany, NY*
*Team: Cooper Meyers, Eileen Dong*

*The adaptive reuse of the Guild House at 62 South Swan St. seeks to
reintroduce the original funtions of this historic site into the modernday
landscape through the concept of folding. There are two dimensions to the
folding. There is a physical folding of the facade and interior partitions, and a
conceptual folding of the past into the present.
The main entrance has been moved from the west face of the building to the
north face to provide an easy and accessible entrance to all. Upon entering the
Guild House, one is greeted with an imagery of a building inside of a building.
The Guild House as it currently sits, is a shell of what it has been. Our proposal
will bring life into this shell by emphasizing the interstitialspaces between the
old and new. This space allows both mental and physical acknowledgment of
the gap that the decline of the Guild House has left in its community.
The large architectural bay window allows one to peer into the new future of
the Guild House, a place to once again server the immigrants and children of
its community. It will provide a variety of classes and services for immigrants
to help them navigate life in the United States, child care for working class
families, and after school programs to help students reach their full potential.*
