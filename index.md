I am currently pursuing an **M.S. in Architecture** (Computational Design) at Georgia Institute of Technology.  
Previously, I earned my **B.Arch** from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, developing strong architectural design  
skills and a passion for computational design. This collection includes contemporary architectural projects and  
design tools I have created.
